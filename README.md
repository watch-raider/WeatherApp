# WeatherApp
Xamarin Forms Weather App created for interview process

Xamarin Forms application which utilises a weather API to display weather from 3-5
different locations shown in a list.

Each list item shows the weather location and temperature. When the list item is
tapped a detail page should be opened showing more detail from the weather API .e.g wind
speed, and humidity.

The app has offline capabilities, i.e. once the weather info has been downloaded
onto mobile, if you close the app and open it again with NO internet you will be able to see the
same information (outdated of course).
